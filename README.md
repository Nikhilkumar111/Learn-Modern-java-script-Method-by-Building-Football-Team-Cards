In this project, we have the use of java script because in this programming language, 
lots of stl and properties are present that we can't remember then we have to practice these types 
of projects that revise these properties very well. In this project, we learn about Dom, object destructuring,
event handling, and data fetching also about object freeze and map used. Also, revise the switch statement.
